Analyzing memory consumption on x-server

1. Assumption: the plugin does not relase some server mem when charts are closed
2. measures:
  a) unchanged
  b) render a 1x1 pixel bitmap before clsoing (to make m_pCloneBM really small)
  c) change the plugin to delete m_pCloneBM when closing a chart

3. setup:
   - 3 chart sets with 872 charts
   - always change some settings after changing the code to trigger cache prefill
   - restart avnav to ge a new log, set mem to 2% (app. 30 charts on 16GB main mem)
   - run checkMem.sh and write output to file
   - periodically run (grep -v AvnavOcharts  ~/avnav/ocharts/provider.log; cat ~/mem.log ) | sort | ./mem.pl 
     to check for app. 100 chart opens
   - write result to file

 4. Results:
 4.1. initial Xvfb rss: app 44M
 4.2. at 100 open/~70 close:
      a) app. 83MB
      b) app. 66.8 MB
      c) app. 66.7 MB
 4.3. usage per open chart (compare initial against 23 open):
      a) 61.7 - 44.5 => 0.86MB/chart
      b) 62.3 - 45.5 => 0.84MB/chart
      c) 62.8 - 46.0 => 0.84MB/chart
 4.4. usage per chart when opening/closing (compare 70 closes agains last 0 closes):
      a) 82.1 - 62.0 => 0.29MB/chart
      b) 66.3 - 63.9 => 0.034MB/chart (app 34kb)
      c) 66.8 - 64.4 => 0.034MB/chart (app 34kb)
       => conclusion: still another mem leak but factor 8 better
       => workaround (minimized bitmap before close) is sufficient
       => should we consider the 0.9MB/open chart when computing limits? 
  5. complete cache prefill run
      b) ends with 118MB Xvfb, 2201 opens, 2173 close
         mem/chart:  118MB-62.6MB/2173 => 0.025MB/chart

       => conclusion: 
       - default settings will give us ~11 charts to be open
       - should give app. 10MB Xvfb increase, start at ~45MB -> 55MB
       - with 0.03MB/close and 150MB for Xvfb we will restart after app. 
         3000 open/close - should be ok for an average user
